# Stripe Integration Updates

## Updates Completed

1. **Updated `setup_security.py`**
   - Added configuration for Stripe API keys (publishable key, secret key, and webhook secret)
   - Added prompts for collecting Stripe API keys during setup
   - Added validation and error handling for missing Stripe configuration

2. **Enhanced `stripe_controller.py`**  
   - Improved error handling and logging in the webhook handler
   - Added additional logging for better debugging
   - Enhanced user look-up to handle client_reference_id conversion from string to int
   - Added fallback to email lookup for user identification
   - Added handling for subscription update and invoice payment failure events

3. **Created Documentation**
   - Added detailed setup guide in `STRIPE_SETUP.md`
   - Included troubleshooting tips and testing procedures
   - Added references to Stripe documentation and resources

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Update Stripe Webhook Secret**
   - The current `.env` file likely contains a placeholder webhook secret
   - Need to replace this with a real webhook secret from Stripe Dashboard

2. **Test Complete Payment Flow**
   - Test the entire flow from checkout to webhook processing
   - Verify premium status updates correctly in the user database

3. **Consider Additional Improvements**
   - Add database logging of payment events for audit purposes
   - Implement notification system for payment failures
   - Add admin interface for managing subscriptions

## Manual Testing

Until the webhook is properly configured with a valid webhook secret, you can use the following methods for testing:

1. Use the `/test-premium` page to toggle premium status manually
2. Monitor authentication state changes with the enhanced `AuthStateLogger`
3. Check application logs for detailed information on webhook processing
