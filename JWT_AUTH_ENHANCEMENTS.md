# JWT Authentication Enhancements

This document provides an overview of the enhancements made to the JWT authentication system in the Quiz App.

## Core Improvements

1. **Automatic Token Refresh**
   - Implemented token refresh mechanism that proactively refreshes tokens before they expire
   - Added scheduleTokenRefresh to manage token refresh timing
   - System now refreshes tokens 45 minutes after login (before the 1-hour expiration)

2. **AuthVerifier Component Enhancements**
   - Added consecutive failures tracking to handle multiple verification failures gracefully
   - Improved error handling with better logging and automatic logout on repeated failures
   - Added token refresh attempt when token verification fails

3. **Cross-Origin Cookie Security**
   - Updated all cookie settings with proper security attributes (Secure, SameSite=None, HttpOnly)
   - Ensured CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin requests
   - Added explicit headers to support older browsers

4. **Improved Auth Context**
   - Enhanced verifyAuthState function to manage token refreshes
   - Improved logout function to clear both local state and server-side tokens
   - Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms

5. **Diagnostic Tools**
   - Created TokenDiagnostics component to help debug authentication issues
   - Added auth-tester.html for testing the entire authentication flow
   - Created auth_test.py script for backend verification

## Debugging Tools

### TokenDiagnostics Component
A floating diagnostic panel that shows:
- Current user authentication status
- Token validity information
- Cookie information
- Allows manual token refresh and verification

### auth-tester.html
A standalone HTML page that tests:
- API connectivity
- Login/logout functionality
- Token verification
- Token refresh
- Cookie handling

### auth_test.py
A Python script that tests:
- API health
- Full authentication flow (login, verification, refresh, logout)
- Cookie handling

## Important Security Notes

1. **Token Storage**
   - No longer storing tokens in localStorage for better security
   - Relying on HTTP-only cookies that can't be accessed by JavaScript

2. **CSRF Protection**
   - The server uses JWT_COOKIE_CSRF_PROTECT in production
   - Tokens are validated on the server side before processing sensitive requests

3. **Cross-Origin Protection**
   - Cookies use SameSite=None with Secure attribute
   - CORS headers are properly configured for allowed origins
   - Preflight requests are correctly handled

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the backend server with `python run.py` from the backend_v2 directory
2. Open the application in your browser and test login functionality
3. Use the auth-tester.html page to verify cookie behavior
4. Use the run_and_test_auth.ps1 script to perform a full test of the auth system

## Additional Considerations

1. **Token Expiration Handling**
   - The system now automatically refreshes tokens before they expire
   - If the refresh token expires (after 30 days), users will need to log in again

2. **Error Recovery**
   - The system can recover from network issues with graceful degradation
   - Multiple layers of verification ensure consistent auth state

3. **Performance**
   - TokenDiagnostics component is only included in development mode
   - Verification intervals are set to avoid excessive API calls
